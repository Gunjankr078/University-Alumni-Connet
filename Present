Got it! You have a **LinkedIn-like university alumni connect platform built with MERN**, and you want to **distribute/present it effectively** with a team of 5 people. Here’s a clear plan to divide the presentation and distribute the workload smoothly:

---

### 1. Structure the Presentation into Clear Sections

Typical flow for your platform demo:

1. **Introduction & Problem Statement**
2. **Architecture & Tech Stack**
3. **Key Features & Demo**
4. **Challenges & Solutions**
5. **Future Enhancements & Conclusion**

### 2. Assign Roles to Each of the 5 People

| Person | Role/Section                           | What to cover                                                                         |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | **Introduction & Problem Statement**   | Why this platform? The gap it fills, target users, goals                              |
| 2      | **Tech Stack & Architecture Overview** | Explain MERN stack, backend, frontend, database design, APIs                          |
| 3      | **Feature Walkthrough & Demo**         | Show sign-up/login, profile creation, networking features, posting, search, messaging |
| 4      | **Challenges Faced & Solutions**       | Technical hurdles (auth, real-time features, scaling), how you fixed them             |
| 5      | **Future Plans & Q\&A**                | What’s next? New features, improvements, answer audience questions                    |

### 3. Tips for Distribution & Presentation

* **Practice smooth transitions** between speakers (“Now, \[name] will take you through...”).
* Each person prepares **slides + demo parts** for their section.
* Include **live demo** of key features — don’t overdo it, pick 2-3 core ones.
* Use visuals like architecture diagrams, flowcharts to explain tech.
* Keep each section **5-7 minutes max** for a 30-35 minute total presentation.
* Have a **backup plan** if demo glitches (screenshots/videos).

### 4. Additional Suggestions for the Alumni Platform Presentation

* Emphasize **real-world impact** (alumni networking, job connections, event invites).
* Showcase **user roles** if you have (e.g., student, alumni, admin).
* Mention any **security measures** like JWT auth, password hashing.
* Highlight **unique features** that differentiate from LinkedIn or similar platforms.
* If you built APIs, demo Postman or explain how frontend talks to backend.
